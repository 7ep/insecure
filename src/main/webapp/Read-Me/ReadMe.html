<b>InsecureWebApp</b> - an OWASP web application

<a href="mailto:insecure@isthmusgroup.com?subject=InsecureWebApp"><img style="border:0px" src="../common/art/isthmusgroup.gif" width="78" height="72" vspace="6"></a>
Version 1.0

<b>NOTICE</b>
InsecureWebApp should be used in secure, local testing environments only.
InsecureWebApp should NOT BE deployed in a public or production environment because this web application 
contains vulnerabilities that could potentially be used to cause harm and/or disclose or alter information.
Please see the end of this file for licensing and copyright information

<b>About InsecureWebApp</b>
The purpose of InsecureWebApp is to demonstrate why vulnerabilities in web applications can cause harm 
and to help developers create more secure applications by understanding how theoretical vulnerabilities 
relate to actual code or deployment configuration and how to fix them.

InsecureWebApp is a database driven J2EE web application for a ficticious company 'American Services Corporation'.

Though small, it demonstrates a variety of web application vulnerabilities including
SQL Injection, HTML Injection (XSS, Reflected XSS), Parameter Tampering, Broken Authentication and Authorization.

<b>Requirements</b>

InsecureWebApp has been developed and tested using a 'typical Java platform' for a small enterprise.
The minimum recommended configuration is - 
Apache Tomcat 4.1.31 with Sun's Java 1.4.2_06

InsecureWebApp uses an in-memory (HSQL) database however other datasources are possible. 

InsecureWebApp is available as a deployable .war file, Eclipse source code project or embedded in Tomcat.

InsecureWebApp should be used in a development system only.


<b>Application Installation Steps:</b>

1. Copy insecure.war file to tomcat's webapp directory

2. Start Tomcat then use sqltest.jsp to test Tomcat's database connection.
<a href="http://localhost:8080/insecure/secure/sqltest.jsp" target="_blank">sqltest.jsp</a>
You should see a list of users and passwords that you can use to login into the application.
Note the application's database tables are reset to the initial values each time the application is started.

3. Login to the application
<a href="http://localhost:8080/insecure/public/Login.jsp" target="_blank">Login</a>

<hr><b>Overview of the application</b>
1. Login as asmith(password- andy), bmoody(beth) and admin(secret). 
Notice that the admin user has additional privileges which can be accessed by clicking on the admin link on the left.
This application implements six use-cases:
1. View account status and Active or Deactivate the account (requires authenticated user with admin rights)
2. View an internal pdf report (requires authenticated user with admin rights)
3. View current account balance summaries and a detail for each account
4. Request a new credit card payment (requires authenticated user)
5. Request a new password via email
6. Lists latest products with a simple search on the name (does not require login)
In addition, an authenticated user can personalize the web site style. Database tables are recreated each time the application initializes.

<b>Challenge #1 - Penetration Test</b>
How many examples of SQL injection and parameter tampering can you find in the app in ten minutes?

Using only the use-cases (and without looking at the source-code) see how many vulnerabilities you can find in 10 minutes (or if you have the time, 30 minutes).
Use a texteditor to jot down each vulnerability you find eg the URL and what kind of vulnerability you found.

<b>Challenge #2 - Servlet source code review</b>
The application uses a custom servlet (ReportServlet) to render reports.
1. Verify that <a href="http://localhost:8080/insecure/report/anything">report/anything</a> is served by the same servlet.
2. Try to use the servlet to serve "web.xml", why doesn't the following link work?
<a href="http://localhost:8080/insecure/report/../web.xml" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/insecure/report/../web.xml</a>
3. Read the source code to <a href="source/ReportServlet.java" target="_blank">ReportServlet</a> and then add one character to the above line to make it work.
4. Once you have web.xml, determine the JNDI name of the database connection and the (fake) user and password used.
5. Would you have spotted this vulnerability by a typical analysis of the source code? Why?

<b>Challenge #3 - Forceful Browsing and Parameter Tampering</b>
1. Can one customer view another customer's records?
2. What would be a minimum fix and what be good fix?

<b>Challenge #4 - Information Disclosure</b>
Developer tools often create old versions of a web page with a different extension. Perhaps Login.bak, Login.jsp.1 made it into production...
<a href="http://localhost:8080/insecure/public/Login.jsp.1" target="_blank">Login.jsp.1</a>
By analyzing the source code of this web page, determine
1. How cookie information is pushed into the session object
2. How authentication is implemented in this application
3. The directory structure of any included web pages.
4. The full name of custom java classes used for the authentication process.
5. What would be a minimum fix and what be good fix?

<b>Challenge #5 - Permanent Cross Site Scripting</b>
1. Find a page that is vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS)
2. Demonstrate that the page is vulnerable by generating an alert (&lt;script&gt;alert(this)&lt;script&gt;)
3. Use XSS to change the user preference's saluation cookie.
4. How could you use this to automatically inject malacious code into every secure page?
5. What would be a minimum fix and what be good fix?

<b>Challenge #6 - Permanent Cross Site Scripting</b>
1. Use SQL injection to inject javascript into every secure page.
2. What would be a minimum fix and what be good fix?

<b>Challenge #7 - Source code review</b>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/insecure/javasrc.zip" target="_blank">Source code(zip)</a>

1. Use SQL injection to inject javascript into every secure page.
2. What would be a minimum fix and what be good fix?

<hr>
<b>MySQL-Specific Installation</b>

To use mysql, additional setup is required (see below). 

1. Create the mysql user and database:
mysql -uroot -p
 CREATE DATABASE asdb;
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON asdb.* TO 'asweb'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'asweb';
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 exit;
 
2. Test the new database and user:
 mysqldump -uasweb -pasweb asdb 
(This should dump the empty asdb database to the console output)

3. Check that you have the mysql jdbc <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/'>driver</a> installed in tomcat/common/lib

4. Copy insecure.xml to Tomcat's webapp directory
<a href="insecure.xml" target="_blank">insecure.xml</a>

The application will attempt to connect to the datasource first and will fall back to the default HSQL implementation if the connection fails.
Please the tomcat logs for details.
